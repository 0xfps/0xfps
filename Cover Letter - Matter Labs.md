Hello Matter Labs,

I hope my application finds you well.

I wish to apply for the Senior Smart Contracts Developer (Solidity) position at your organization. I am positive that I can help with Matter Labs' responsibilities of the position.

Having more than 1 year experience writing Smart Contracts for the Ethereum and Polygon blockchain, I am confident that I am qualified for the position.

At my current position at Tecmie Labs, I have written and tested Smart Contracts leveraging POAPs, Soulbound, ERC721A and ERC721 Token standards, alongside contracts that utilize DeFi staking and rewarding protocols.

I know that Matter Labs' plans include developing and testing safe and secure Smart Contracts which is a perfect match for my professional interests, and I would love to leverage my knowledge of Smart Contract Development to achieve groundbreaking results with this initiative.

Thank you for taking time to read this and I hope to speak with you again.

Sincerely,
Nnaemeka Anthony Umeh
